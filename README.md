currently just a black hole.
I still need some time with this once i gain some sort of confidence in my future in this crazy place. The tactics are ridiculous but also take you to an extreme level of thought and reflection. multiply a normal experince by about how much of my money i see just chilling on the block mocking me and it still doesnt compare. haha... I need to go poke around a bit but ill be back. Than You... i hope :
